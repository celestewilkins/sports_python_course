    "In Python, libraries or \"packages\" contain pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks. To use these, you need to **import** them. \n",

    "#### **Introduction to Numpy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It is especially useful for handling arrays of numbers, which are common in sports data (e.g., player speeds, joint angles, or force values over time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of Numpy arrays:\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Arrays are faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists for numerical data.\n",
    "- **Element-wise operations**: Perform operations on entire arrays at once.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality**: Numpy arrays can be 1D, 2D, or even higher dimensions.\n",

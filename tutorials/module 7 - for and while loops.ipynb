    "Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. They are especially useful for processing collections like lists, dictionaries, or dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides two main types of loops:\n",
    "1. **`for` loops**: Iterate over a sequence (e.g., a list or dictionary).\n",
    "2. **`while` loops**: Repeat code as long as a condition is `True`.\n",

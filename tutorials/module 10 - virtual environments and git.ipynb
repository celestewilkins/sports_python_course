    "A **virtual environment** is an isolated environment where you can install Python libraries and manage dependencies for your project. With **Anaconda**, managing virtual environments is simple and efficient.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Why Use Virtual Environments?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keeps your project dependencies isolated from the system Python or other projects.\n",
    "2. Makes it easier to reproduce your project setup on another machine.\n",
    "3. Helps avoid version conflicts between libraries.\n",

    "### **Setting Up a Virtual Environment with Anaconda**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the **Anaconda Prompt** or your terminal.\n",
    "2. Create a new virtual environment using the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda create --name env_name python=3.9\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `env_name` with the name of your virtual environment (e.g., `sports_env`) and specify the Python version you need.\n",

    "\n",
    "``` bash \n",
    "conda activate env_name\n",
    "```\n",

    "Install packages in the environment using `conda` or `pip`. For example:\n",

    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git init\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stage Changes**\n",

    "     git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "     git push -u origin main\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check the Status**\n",
    "   - View the status of your repository to see which files have been modified or staged:\n",

    "   - Commit the file with the message `\"Add data analysis script\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Push your changes to a new GitHub repository named `sports_project`.\n",

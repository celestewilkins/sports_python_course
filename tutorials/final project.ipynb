    "## **Step 1: Setting Up the Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Clone the Repository**\n",
    "1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Clone the repository containing the tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Set Up a Virtual Environment**\n",
    "1. Open the **Anaconda Prompt** or your terminal.\n",
    "2. Create a new virtual environment:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda create --name baseball_analysis python=3.9\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate the environment\n",
    "    ```bash \n",
    "    conda activate baseball_analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Understand the Data Structure**\n",
    "The game files are located in the `game_files` folder. Each CSV file contains data for one simulated game, including:\n",
    "- Player details.\n",
    "- Pitches and hits.\n",
    "- Performance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Load the Data**\n",
    "Use Pandas to load and explore the data. Hereâ€™s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load all game files\n",
    "game_folder = \"game_files\"\n",
    "game_files = [os.path.join(game_folder, file) for file in os.listdir(game_folder)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combine all games into one DataFrame\n",
    "all_games = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(file) for file in game_files])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the first few rows\n",
    "print(all_games.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 3: Player Comparisons Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Goals**\n",
    "1. Compare player performance across all games.\n",
    "2. Analyze trends such as:\n",
    "   - Total pitches and hits.\n",
    "   - Hit rates (hits per pitch).\n",
    "   - Performance consistency across games.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 4: Perform Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Aggregate Player Statistics**\n",
    "- Calculate total pitches and hits for each player.\n",
    "For example you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Aggregate total pitches and hits for each player\n",
    "player_stats = all_games.groupby(\"Player\")[[\"PitchNo\", \"Hits\"]].sum()\n",
    "player_stats[\"Hit Rate\"] = player_stats[\"Hits\"] / player_stats[\"PitchNo\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the top 5 players by total hits\n",
    "print(player_stats.sort_values(by=\"Hits\", ascending=False).head())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort players by hit rate\n",
    "sorted_players = player_stats.sort_values(by=\"Hit Rate\", ascending=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plot hit rates\n",
    "sorted_players[\"Hit Rate\"].plot(kind=\"bar\", color=\"green\")\n",
    "plt.title(\"Player Hit Rates\")\n",
    "plt.xlabel(\"Player\")\n",
    "plt.ylabel(\"Hit Rate\")\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
